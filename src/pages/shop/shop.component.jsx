     * ðŸ˜« Problem ==> Our loading state is also attached to this collection inside this
     * componentDidMount code.
     *
     * What is needed ==> We want to be able to abstract all of this into it's own reusable part
     * of the code. The great thing is that as far as the state goes we can probably actually
     * already imagine that we should put the loading in a Redux state.
     *
     * ðŸ¤” The other thing however is that if our redux was actually able to handle async event-handling
     * we can actually move the async code into an action and then dispatch it accordingly.
     *
     * ðŸ¤© Solution ==> Redux & Redux-Thunk (Redux-Thunk allows us to handle asynchronous event-handling and firing multiple actions)
